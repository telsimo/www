iSIM in 2023: where do we stand?

Last year, Vodafone, Qualcomm Technologies, and Thales successfully demonstrated a smartphone that utilizes iSIM technology. 

Now, we have the first-ever eSA certification of an iSIM defined by the GSMA (GSMA eUICC Security Assurance certification). This confirms that iSIM supports the same high standards of cyber-protection and flexible 'anytime, anywhere' connectivity offered by Remote SIM Provisioning (RSP).

The growth of IoT will come from the massive roll-out of low-power devices: OEMs will primarily benefit from lower material and power consumption bills.

The two most promising evolutions are reducing the subscription profiles in size and using consumer RSP technology instead of M2M.

Unlike IoT, consumer devices typically host a range of services that demand security and privacy to protect end users.

The iSIM for consumer devices is based on a framework that will support connectivity with an RSP-capable SIM functionality and other services like transportation, payment, and ID.

What's next?

The iSIM will be first made available in high-end, innovative smartphones in the consumer electronics space. It will deliver its full promise when entry/mid-range smartphones and wearables are available.

Recent research foresees that by 2025, there could be 200 million iSIM-compliant consumer and IoT devices in the field.
